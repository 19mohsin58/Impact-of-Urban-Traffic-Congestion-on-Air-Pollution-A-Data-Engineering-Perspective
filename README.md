# Impact of Urban Traffic Congestion on Air Pollution: A Data Engineering Perspective

### ABSTRACT:

This project aims to investigate the correlation between urban traffic congestion and air pollution using real-world data from the OpenAQ (Air Quality) and TomTom (Traffic) datasets. By applying the complete data engineering lifecycle—data ingestion, cleaning, transformation, integration, and preparation for analysis—we explore how traffic patterns affect air quality in cities. The study demonstrates how robust data engineering pipelines can prepare multi-source data for environmental impact analysis and model-ready insights.

### Introduction
Air pollution is a major concern in urban centers worldwide, with vehicular traffic being a significant contributor to harmful emissions. Real-time monitoring of both traffic congestion and air quality presents an opportunity to explore their interrelation. However, combining heterogeneous datasets with differing structures poses challenges that require structured data engineering practices.
